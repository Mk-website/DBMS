        <p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a powerful programming language designed for managing and manipulating
            relational databases. Developed in the 1970s, SQL has become the standard language for interacting with
            databases, providing a standardized way to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and defining
            database structures.</p>
        <h2>Key Concepts of SQL:</h2>
        <p><b><u>Data Definition Language (DDL):</u></b> DDL commands enable users to define and manage the structure of a
            database. This includes creating and altering database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.</p>
        <p><b>Data Manipulation Language (DML):</b> SQL includes commands for querying and modifying data within a
            database. Common DML commands include SELECT (retrieve data), INSERT (add new records), UPDATE (modify existing
            records), and DELETE (remove records).</p>
        <p><b>Control Language (DCL):</b> DCL commands govern access to the database. They include commands such as GRANT
            (assign privileges) and REVOKE (remove privileges), which control who can access and manipulate data within the
            database.</p></div>
