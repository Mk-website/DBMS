    <div id="outputframe"><h2>What is Views?</h2>
        <p>In databases, a view is a virtual table that is based on the result set of a SELECT query. Unlike physical tables, views do not store data themselves; they are essentially saved queries that dynamically generate the result set when queried. Views can simplify complex queries, abstract the underlying data model, and provide a security mechanism by restricting access to certain columns or rows of a table.</p>
        <h2>Key Points of Views:</h2>
        <p><b><u>Structure:</u></b> Views have a structure similar to tables, with columns and rows, but they do not store any data directly.</p>
        <p><b><u>Virtual:</u></b> Views are virtual tables, meaning they are not physical entities and do not occupy storage space.</p>
        <p><b><u>Schema Binding:</u></b> Views can be schema-bound, meaning they are bound to the schema of the underlying tables. This ensures that the underlying schema cannot be modified in a way that would break the view.</p>
        <p><b><u>Security:</u></b> Views can be used to control access to data by providing a restricted view of the underlying tables. Users can be granted access to views without granting direct access to the underlying tables.</p>
        <p><b><u>Complex Queries:</u></b> Views can simplify complex queries by encapsulating logic and calculations into a single object that can be queried like a table.</p>
        <p><b><u>Performance:</u></b> Views can improve query performance by pre-computing and caching results, especially for frequently used or complex queries.</p>
        <p><b><u>Modifiability:</u></b> Some views are updatable, meaning they can be used to insert, update, or delete rows from the underlying tables, provided certain conditions are met.</p>
